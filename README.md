# Qualendar

Qualendar is a web application that allows you to view your Google Calendar directly on the website when you're signed in to your Google account. In future versions, you'll also be able to see the weather forecast for each day.

## About

Qualendar was created to make it easier for people to access and manage their Google Calendar. We noticed that many people have their calendar open in a separate tab or application while they work, which can be distracting and take up valuable screen real estate. By integrating the calendar directly into the Qualendar website, we hope to make it more convenient and seamless to manage your schedule.

In addition to the calendar functionality, we're also working on adding a weather forecast feature to Qualendar. This will allow you to quickly check the weather for the day without needing to open a separate app or website.

We're committed to making Qualendar as user-friendly and accessible as possible. If you have any feedback or suggestions for how we can improve the app, please don't hesitate to let us know!

## Installation

Qualendar is a web-based application, so you don't need to install anything on your computer. Simply go to the website [qualendar.vercel.app](https://qualendar.vercel.app/) and sign in with your Google account to access your calendar.

## Usage

Once you're signed in to your Google account, Qualendar will display your calendar for the current month. You can click on any day to view the events for that day, or use the navigation arrows to switch between months.
